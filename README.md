# pusher_client

Plugin for pusher client in dart. Only supports android at the moment. I created this plugin for my convenience and only contains functions which were important for my app. For a more complete libray visit [https://github.com/chinloyal/pusher_client](https://github.com/chinloyal/pusher_client). However this library doesn't support null safety which was the prime reason I couldn't use it. Any suggetions or additions would be appreciated :D
